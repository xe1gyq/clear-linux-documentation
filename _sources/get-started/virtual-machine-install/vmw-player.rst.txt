|CL-ATTR| on VMware\* Workstation Player
########################################

This page explains how to create a new VMware Workstation Player hypervisor and use one of two images: the |CL| Desktop installer iso, or the |CL| Pre-configured VMWare image.

Overview
********

`VMware Workstation Player`_ is a type 2 hypervisor. It runs on top of
Windows\* or Linux\* operating systems. With VMware Workstation Player, 
you can create, configure, manage, and run |CL-ATTR| 
:abbr:`VMs (Virtual Machines)` on your local system.

VMware offers a type 1 hypervisor called `VMware ESXi`_ designed for the
cloud environment. For information on how to install |CL| as guest OS on
it, see :ref:`vmware-esxi-install-cl`.

.. note::

   The screenshots on this document show the Windows version of the
   VMware Workstation 15 Player. The menus and prompts are similar to those
   in other versions and for the Linux OS save some minor wording 
   differences.

Install the VMware Workstation Player hypervisor
************************************************

#. Enable :abbr:`Intel速 VT (Intel速 Virtualization Technology)` and
   :abbr:`Intel速 VT-d (Intel速 Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O)` in
   your system's BIOS.

#. `VMware Workstation Player`_ is available for Windows and Linux.
   Download your preferred version.

   .. note::

      By default, selecting download means you receive the latest version
      of this application. Commands may differ based on the version.

#. Install VMware Workstation Player by following the instructions
   appropriate for your system OS:

   * On supported Linux distros:

     #. Enable a GUI desktop.
     #. Start a terminal emulator.
     #. Start the installer by issuing the command below and follow the
        guided steps.

        .. code-block:: console

           sudo sh ./VMware-Player-[version number].x86_64.bundle

   * On Windows:

     #. Start the installer.
     #. Follow the setup wizard.

For additional help, see the `VMware Workstation Player Documentation`_.

Create and configure a new VM
*****************************

#. Start the ``VMware Workstation Player`` app.

#. On the home screen, click :guilabel:`Create a New Virtual Machine`. See
   Figure 1.

      Figure 3: VMware Workstation Player - Select guest operating system
      type

#. Set the :guilabel:`Version` setting to
   :guilabel:`Other Linux 5.x or later kernel 64-bit`.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Next` button.

#. On the :guilabel:`Name the Virtual Machine` screen, name the new VM. See
   Figure 4.

      Figure 5: VMware Workstation Player - Set disk capacity

   .. note::

      For optimal performance with the |CL| Desktop image, we recommend 32GB
      of drive space. See :ref:`system-requirements` for more details.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Next` button.

#. On the :guilabel:`Ready to Create Virtual Machine` screen, click the
   :guilabel:`Customize Hardware...` button. See Figure 6.

      :alt: VMware Workstation Player - Set memory size

      Figure 7: VMware Workstation Player - Set memory size

   .. note::

      The |CL| installer ISO needs a minimum of 2GB of RAM.
      After completing installation, |CL| can run on as little as
      128MB of RAM. Thus, you can reduce the memory size if needed.
      See :ref:`system-requirements` for more details.

#. Under the :guilabel:`Device` list, select :guilabel:`Processors`. See
   Figure 8.

   .. figure:: /_figures/vmw-player/vmw-player-08.png

      option

#. Under :guilabel:`Processors` and :guilabel:`Number of processor cores`, 
   enter 4. 

#. Under the :guilabel:`Virtualization engine` section,
   check :guilabel:`Virtualize Intel VT-x/EPT or AMD-V/RVI`.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Close` button.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Finish` button.

Enable UEFI boot support
************************

|CL| needs UEFI support to boot. To enable UEFI:

#. Power off the VM. click the :guilabel:`Player` menu. See Figure 9.

   .. code-block:: console

      firmware = "efi"

   .. note::

      Depending on the OS, you can typically find the VMware VM files under:

      * On Linux distros: :file:`/home/username/vmware`
      * On Windows: :file:`C:\\Users\\username\\Documents\\Virtual Machines`

Download the latest |CL| image

Install open-vm-tools
*********************

Optional: You may want to install the `open-vm-tools` in your virtual
machine. The Open Virtual Machine Tools (open-vm-tools) are the open source
implementation of VMware Tools for Linux\* guest operating systems.

#. Power on your |CL| virtual machine. On the 
:guilabel:`VMware Workstation Player` home screen, select your VM. 
See Figure 10.

#. Click :guilabel:`Play virtual machine`.

#. In |CL| you can install the bundle, and enable the tools, in your VM.

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo swupd bundle-add os-cloudguest-vmware
      sudo systemctl enable --now open-vm-tools
